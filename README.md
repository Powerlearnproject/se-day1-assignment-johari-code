#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the discipline of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications and systems. It involves applying engineering principles to software development, focusing on creating reliable, efficient, and scalable software solutions.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The term "software engineering" was introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This marked a shift from ad-hoc programming to a structured engineering discipline aimed at improving software reliability and efficiency.

The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s)
Object-oriented programming (OOP) became widely adopted, with languages like C++ and Java making code more reusable and modular. This helped improve software maintainability and scalability.

The Agile Revolution (2001 - Present)
The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, emphasized flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative development. This led to widespread adoption of Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban, making software development more adaptive to changing requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Define project scope, feasibility, objectives and gather and document user and system requirements.
Design – Create system architecture, UI/UX design, and technical specifications.
Development – Developers write and test the actual code.
Testing – Ensure the software meets requirements and is bug-free.
Deployment – Release the software to users or clients.
Maintenance – Provide updates, bug fixes, and improvements post-launch.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall methodology is a sequential and structured approach where each phase (planning, design, development, testing, and deployment) is completed before moving to the next. Changes are difficult to accommodate once development begins, and the final product is delivered only at the end. For example, a government agency developing a large-scale ERP system would use Waterfall, as the requirements are well-defined, and regulatory compliance must be ensured before deployment.
                                                                    While
 The Agile methodology is iterative and flexible, allowing teams to adapt to changes quickly. Software is developed and released in small increments, with continuous testing and feedback throughout the process. For example, a startup developing a mobile app would benefit from Agile, as user feedback can guide frequent updates, feature enhancements, and bug fixes without waiting for a full product launch.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

a) Software Developer – Writes, tests, and maintains code. Collaborates with designers and engineers to implement features.
b) Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Ensures software meets quality standards through various testing techniques. Identifies and reports bugs.
c) Project Manager – Oversees the project timeline, scope, and resources. Ensures collaboration between teams and manages risks.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

a) IDEs (Integrated Development Environments):
Help developers write, debug, and test code efficiently. Examples:Visual Studio Code (lightweight, extensible)
IntelliJ IDEA (great for Java development)
b) Version Control Systems (VCS):
Track code changes, enable collaboration, and allow rollback if needed. Example Git (widely used, supports branching and merging)
SVN (centralized version control)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

a) Scope Creep – Frequent changes in requirements.
Solution: Use Agile methodologies for incremental development and maintain clear documentation.

b) Debugging Complex Issues – Bugs can be hard to trace.
Solution: Use debugging tools, write unit tests, and conduct peer code reviews.

c)Keeping Up with New Technologies – Rapid changes in frameworks and languages.
Solution: Continuous learning through courses, conferences, and online communities.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

a) Unit Testing – Tests individual components (e.g., a single function). Ensures code correctness at a micro-level.
b) Integration Testing – Checks how different modules interact. Prevents issues when combining code from multiple developers.
c) System Testing – Tests the entire application as a whole. Verifies compliance with requirements.
d) Acceptance Testing – Ensures the software meets user expectations before deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective inputs (prompts) to get the best responses from AI models. It helps ensure clear, accurate, and useful interactions with AI.
Its importance are
a) Reduces misunderstandings in AI responses.
b) Enhances efficiency by generating precise answers.
c) Helps AI produce creative and context-aware outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: Tell me about space.
Improved Prompt: Give a brief explanation of black holes, including how they form and their effects on surrounding matter.

This prompt is better because,
It is specific (focuses on black holes).
It provides context (formation and effects).
It ensures a concise response rather than a broad, generic answer.
